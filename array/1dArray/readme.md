Q. Consider an one dimensional array SALE that maintains the annual sales of a product from 2001-2019. Let SALE=1000 and each element of array occupies 4 bytes of memory. Find the address of SALE[2006], SALE[2010] and SALE[2017].

To solve this problem, we will use the **formula for computing the address of an element in a one-dimensional array**:

\[
\text{Address of SALE[i]} = \text{Base Address} + (i - \text{Lower Bound}) \times \text{Size of Each Element}
\]

### Given:
- **Base Address** = `1000`
- **Lower Bound** = `2001` (starting year of the array)
- **Size of Each Element** = `4 bytes`
- **Indices to find:** `SALE[2006]`, `SALE[2010]`, `SALE[2017]`

### Calculations:

#### 1. Address of `SALE[2006]`
\[
\text{Address} = 1000 + (2006 - 2001) \times 4
\]
\[
= 1000 + 5 \times 4
\]
\[
= 1000 + 20 = 1020
\]

#### 2. Address of `SALE[2010]`
\[
\text{Address} = 1000 + (2010 - 2001) \times 4
\]
\[
= 1000 + 9 \times 4
\]
\[
= 1000 + 36 = 1036
\]

#### 3. Address of `SALE[2017]`
\[
\text{Address} = 1000 + (2017 - 2001) \times 4
\]
\[
= 1000 + 16 \times 4
\]
\[
= 1000 + 64 = 1064
\]

### Final Answers:
- **SALE[2006] =** `1020`
- **SALE[2010] =** `1036`
- **SALE[2017] =** `1064`





# Question->  Why is not base address 2001 , since it is the lower bound the starting index point !!

The **base address** of an array refers to the **starting memory location** where the first element of the array (in this case, `SALE[2001]`) is stored in memory. It is **not** related to the logical index (or year in this case) but rather to the memory location where the array is allocated.

---

### Why is the base address `1000` and not `2001`?

1. The problem statement **explicitly** states that the base address is `1000`. This means that `SALE[2001]` is stored at memory location `1000`.
2. The **index values** (years 2001-2019) are just logical identifiers, not memory addresses.
3. Memory addresses are assigned **sequentially**, with each element taking `4 bytes`.

---

### Key Concept: Logical Index vs Memory Address

- **Logical Index** â†’ Represents the conceptual position in the array (`SALE[2001]`, `SALE[2002]`, etc.).
- **Memory Address** â†’ The actual physical location in RAM where data is stored (`1000`, `1004`, `1008`, etc.).

If the base address were `2001`, it would mean that `SALE[2001]` is stored at address `2001`, which is **not** given in the problem.

---

### Example (Memory Representation)

| Index (`SALE[i]`) | Offset Calculation | Address |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| `SALE[2001]`    | `1000 + (2001-2001) * 4 = 1000` | `1000` |
| `SALE[2002]`    | `1000 + (2002-2001) * 4 = 1004` | `1004` |
| `SALE[2003]`    | `1000 + (2003-2001) * 4 = 1008` | `1008` |

You can see that the memory addresses **increment by 4 bytes** for each year.

---

### **Final Takeaway**
- **Base address is always a memory location, not an index.**
- The base address **1000** is given in the question.
- We use the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Address} = \text{Base Address} + (i - \text{Lower Bound}) \times \text{Size of Each Element}
  \]
  
  

  Great question! Memory usage for **char, int, string, and other data types** depends on the **programming language** and the **architecture of the system**. Let's break it down for **general cases** (C/C++/Java) and **JavaScript specifically**.

---

## **Memory Usage in C/C++/Java (Typed Languages)**
These languages use **fixed** memory sizes for primitive types.

| Data Type | Memory Usage (in bytes) |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **char** | 1 byte (8 bits) |
| **int** | 4 bytes (32 bits) |
| **float** | 4 bytes (32 bits) |
| **double** | 8 bytes (64 bits) |
| **long** (C++, Java) | 8 bytes (64 bits) |
| **string** | Depends on the number of characters + metadata |

ðŸ”¹ **Strings in C/C++/Java**:  
- In **C**, a string is an array of characters ending in a **null terminator (`\0`)**, so it takes `(number of characters + 1)` bytes.
- In **C++ (std::string)** and **Java (String class)**, a string is an **object**, meaning it has extra overhead (like length, reference pointers, etc.).

---

## **Memory Usage in JavaScript (Dynamic Typing)**
JavaScript does **not** have fixed-size primitive types like C++ or Java. Instead, it uses **dynamic memory allocation**, and sizes depend on the JavaScript engine (V8, SpiderMonkey, etc.).

| Data Type | Approx. Memory Usage |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Number (int/float)** | 8 bytes (JavaScript uses 64-bit floating point for all numbers) |
| **String** | `2 bytes per character` (UTF-16 encoding) |
| **Boolean** | 4 bytes (internally stored as a 32-bit integer) |
| **Object / Array** | **Depends on properties and elements** |

ðŸ”¹ **Why do numbers always take 8 bytes in JavaScript?**  
JavaScript stores **all numbers** as **64-bit floating point (IEEE 754)**, even if you use an integer.

ðŸ”¹ **Strings in JavaScript:**  
- Each character takes **2 bytes** because JavaScript uses **UTF-16 encoding**.
- Example: `"Hello"` (5 characters) takes **10 bytes**.

---

### **Comparison Example**
| Data Type  | C++ / Java | JavaScript |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| `int`      | 4 bytes   | 8 bytes (Number) |
| `char`     | 1 byte    | 2 bytes (UTF-16 char in a string) |
| `string "Hi"` | 3 bytes (2 chars + `\0`) | 4 bytes (2 Ã— 2 bytes per char) |

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **C/C++/Java** have **fixed-size** data types, leading to predictable memory usage.
2. **JavaScript** uses **dynamic memory allocation**, making its memory usage variable and sometimes **less efficient**.
3. **Numbers in JavaScript** always take **8 bytes** because they are stored as **64-bit floating-point values**.
4. **Strings in JavaScript** take **2 bytes per character** due to **UTF-16 encoding**.
